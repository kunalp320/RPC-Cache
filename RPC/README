To build the code, just run 'make' in the directory.

You can set WITH_DEBUG_MESSAGES = 1 in the makefile if you want the client and server to be verbose (it is slow because the client create one .html file per page received from the server).

To run the server:		./proxy_server port cache_policy (LRU, FIFO, LFU, Random NoCache),  cache_size (in Bytes)

e.g:				./proxy_server 9000 LRU 10000000		


To run the client:		./proxy_client host port urls_file

e.g:				./proxy_client localhost 9000 randomURLS

We used 3 URL files: randomURLS to initialize the cache (before each measure), testcase1 and testcase2.
